Welcome to Lilia's world! A magical world set to both be you assistant and your guide. Once you become more experienced with coding your own file you can even get access to this repository and start adding to it yourself!

Here right now are two files:
1- lilasworld.py: A python file that acts as your personal assistant! You should be able to run this directly in your mac terminal but I can help you with getting it started.

2- Beep.ipynb: The Bestie Exploratory Expedetion of Python (Beep for short). A small jupyter notebook that explains how the previous code was made, how you can make it yourself and even how you can add to it.

Soon it will be filled with wonders and joys beyond the hearts imagination. Just like what you bring into our lives. I am your bestie and this is your first soft skill sunday.
